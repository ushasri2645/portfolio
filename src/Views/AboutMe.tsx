                    My journey in technology is like a coin, with two distinct
                    yet complementary sides. One side is my passion for Full
                    Stack Development, where I build seamless, user-centric
                    applications. The other side is my deep interest in Data
                    Science, where I extract insights from data to drive
                    decisions.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white text-justify">
                    While I began with half knowledge, much like Abhimanyu, my
                    pursuit of learning has been relentless, aiming to achieve
                    the mastery of Arjun. I am continually evolving, striving to
                    become a well-rounded technologist by balancing software
                    development and data science expertise.

                <p className="text-white text-justify">
                    On a personal level, I believe in being kind, loyal, and
                    disciplinedâ€”values that drive both my professional and
                    personal life. I am also deeply curious and goal-oriented,
                    always seeking to improve and explore new technologies. I
                    believe that perseverance and a positive mindset are key to
                    overcoming challenges and achieving success in all aspects
                    of life.
